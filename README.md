# Dukaan Dashboard - Pixel Perfect UI

## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of a pixel-perfect implementation of the Dukaan Dashboard UI, as originally outlined in a tweet by Subhash Sir.

The project is bootstrapped using Vite and developed with React, incorporating Tailwind CSS for styling. Code-splitting practices and reusable components have been employed to reduce code repetition.

## Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Tried to give it a pixel-perfect look as much as possible.
- **React Framework**: Utilizes the React framework for efficient UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable styling.
- **Code Splitting**: Code-splitting for improved maintainability.
- **Reusable Components**: Developed with reusability in mind to ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
